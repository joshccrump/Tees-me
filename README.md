# Teesâ€‘me Square Sync Reset

All automation that previously synchronized this project with Square has been removed. Scripts, workflows, and documentation that referenced Square environment variables or credentials are no longer present so you can start over with a clean slate.

The sample catalog files in `data/products.json` and `_data/square_products.json` now exist only as placeholders. Replace them with new exports once you wire up a fresh integration.

To preview the static demo locally, install dependencies (if any) and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Feel free to introduce new tooling or documentation when you are ready to rebuild the Square sync.
